/**
 * CS 141: Intro to Programming and Problem Solving
 * Professor: Edwin Rodr√≠guez
 *
 * Final Group Project (Security Breach)
 *
 * Description of assignment: Our group is making a text-based game called
 * Security Breach. The player starts out with at the bottom left of a 9x9
 * grid room. 9 out of 81 rooms will contain a briefcase with classified
 * information that the player needs to retrieve. The 9 rooms with the
 * briefcase will be evenly distributed throughout the 9x9 grid room.
 * However, all the rooms in the building are dark. The player is equipped
 * with night-vision goggles which allows him or her to see two squares
 * ahead of him. It will not be easy for the player to advance through the
 * map because there are 6 ninja-assassins patrolling the building. If a
 * ninja-assassin ends up in the same room as the player, the player will be
 * stabbed loses a life. The player start out with 3 lives. Everytime a life
 * is lost, the player is sent back to the beginning where he or she first
 * started off. The player can protect himself by shooting his gun in any
 * direction. If the bullet hits a ninja-assassin(s), it will die and be
 * eliminated from game. To help the player, there are three power-up items
 * that are randomly placed throughout the grid. This includes a
 * invicibility shield (protects player from stabbing for 5 turns), radar
 * (display location of the briefcase), and bullet drop (player can only
 * have one bullet on him. If this item is picked up with the character
 * still having a bullet, the effect will be negated).
 * 
 * Team: We showed up
